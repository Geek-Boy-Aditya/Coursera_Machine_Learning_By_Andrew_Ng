[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —Arthur Samuel, 1959

[Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem:] A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if itsperformance on T, as measured by P, improveswith experience E.

## Week 1

I have started doing Andrew Ng’s popular machine learning course on Coursera. The first week covers a lot, at least for someone who hasn’t touched much calculus for a few years

#### Cost Functions (mean difference squared)

We need a function that will minimize the parameters over our dataset. One common function that is often used is mean squared error, which measure the difference between the estimator (the dataset) and the estimated value (the prediction). It looks like this

#### Gradient Descent

#### Linear Regression
